# Statement of Work: Refactoring Pexels Banner Plugin Settings

## Objective
Refactor the Pexels Banner Plugin to move all settings-related code into a separate file `src/settings.js` while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Steps

- [x] 1. Create a new file `src/settings.js`

- [x] 2. Move the following classes and constants to `src/settings.js`:
  - [x] `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`
  - [x] `FolderSuggestModal`
  - [x] `FolderImageSetting`
  - [x] `PexelsBannerSettingTab`

- [x] 3. Add necessary imports to `src/settings.js`:
  - [x] `import { PluginSettingTab, Setting, FuzzySuggestModal } from 'obsidian';`

- [x] 4. Export the moved classes and constants from `src/settings.js`:
  - [x] `export { DEFAULT_SETTINGS, FolderSuggestModal, FolderImageSetting, PexelsBannerSettingTab };`

- [x] 5. Update `src/main.js`:
  - [x] Remove the moved classes and constants
  - [x] Add import statement: `import { DEFAULT_SETTINGS, PexelsBannerSettingTab } from './settings';`

- [x] 6. Ensure `this.plugin` is correctly passed to `PexelsBannerSettingTab` in `src/main.js`

- [x] 7. Move any helper functions used only in settings (e.g., `debounce`) to `src/settings.js`

- [x] 8. Update any references to moved functions or classes in both files

- [ ] 9. Test the plugin thoroughly to ensure all functionality still works:
  - [ ] Test all settings in the settings tab
  - [ ] Test banner display and updates in notes
  - [ ] Test folder-specific settings
  - [ ] Test custom field names

- [ ] 10. Update any necessary documentation or comments in both files

- [ ] 11. Review and clean up any unused imports or variables in both files

- [ ] 12. Commit changes and update version number if necessary

## Notes
- Ensure that the plugin's existing functionality remains intact throughout this refactoring process.
- Pay special attention to maintaining the correct context (`this`) when moving methods and classes.
- Double-check that all dependencies and imports are correctly managed in both files.
